# Normalization

Dundua et al describe a formal framework for matching in associative and commutative
theories. A key component of their system is a normal form for terms. The
ordering of function symbols, terms, and term sequences is arbitrary but fixed.

The system does not account for distributive functions, so mathematical
expressions (for example) are not semantically unique w.r.t. normal form. They
are only unique w.r.t. the chosen well-founded total ordering, associativity and
commutativity. My mental model is to think of it as an extension of lexicographic
ordering.

The matching algorithm for commutative and associative matching requires that
expressions be in _C-normal form_ (for commutative), _A-normal form_ (for
associative), or _AC-normal form_ (for both), depending on the type of the
expression and role it serves in the algorithm. We will just say normal form
instead of AC-normal form.
